# How to Get Unbanned on Marvel Rivals (2025 Guide) ⚡️

Getting banned from Marvel Rivals can be a total mood killer, especially when you feel like you didn’t even break a single rule. Don’t panic! This easy-peasy guide will walk you through what to do if Marvel Rivals locks you out, and how to appeal that ban like a pro so you can jump back into the action.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned the moment you tried logging in on a new account? Or maybe every account you make gets zapped? You could be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Marvel Rivals flags your device’s hardware, making it tricky to just jump back in with a fresh account.
